# DataCamp coding test

A response to: https://github.com/datacamp-engineering/coding-test-simulate-a-robot

[robot-simulator.js](https://github.com/joe-dev-public/fac-datacamp-coding-test/blob/main/robot-simulator.js) contains the code that I wrote in response to this challenge.

[robot-simulator.spec.js](https://github.com/joe-dev-public/fac-datacamp-coding-test/blob/main/robot-simulator.spec.js) mostly contains the tests that DataCamp provided, but I added a few of my own.
