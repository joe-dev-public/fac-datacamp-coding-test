# DataCamp coding test

[robot-simulator.js](https://github.com/joe-dev-public/fac-datacamp-coding-test/blob/main/robot-simulator.js) contains the code that I wrote in response to this challenge.

[robot-simulator.spec.js](https://github.com/joe-dev-public/fac-datacamp-coding-test/blob/main/robot-simulator.spec.js) mostly contains the tests that DataCamp provided (in the above repo), plus a few of my own.

All tests pass ✔️
